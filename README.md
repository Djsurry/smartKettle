i drink a lot of tea. this is a project im working on that should make me 
tea when i click a button on an app along with allowing me to set "tea alarms", pretty much just makes tea at a set time

I ripped apart an old coffee maker, yoinked the heating elemented out of that and installed an rpi to control said 
heating element. Furthermore, there are some holes drilled near the bottom of the water holding tank in the coffee maker
in which are som wires. They will check if there is electric current passing between them, meaning the water is at a 
high enough level. This is so the thing doesnt go endlessly without water. Hard to replicate but maybe someone can use
the code somehow
